=======Description=========

This program was made to analyze rain data provided by the Bocas Del Toro Field 
Station in Panama. This was used to help EWB-RPI (Engineers Without Borders -
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) with their alternatives analysis. More
specifically to decide whether the community of approx 300 people in 
Bocas Del Toro could use rain water as a sustainable source of drinking water.

========Motivation/Background==========

I started this project last semester (Fall 2012) as I was becoming familiar 
R and now am returning to it for 2 reasons. One the code I had then was 
a disaster and now that I know more about R I plan to fix it. Also this is
to handle new data going from 2002 to 2013 rather then the 2005 to 2010 data
that was used previously. I hope to make the code as reusable as possible so
that if we get updated data we can quickly re analyze next time.
